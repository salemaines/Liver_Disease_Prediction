# Liver_Disease_Prediction

This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify and diagnose liver disease using various environmental and genetic features. The goal is to build an accurate model that can assist in predicting the likelihood of liver disease based on the provided features, helping in early diagnosis and improving personalized treatment.

This project uses a dataset from Kaggle. It contains 1,700 records with 11 features, including both environmental and genetic factors that may contribute to liver disease. The dataset is preprocessed and does not contain missing values or outliers.

Key Attributes:
Number of records: 1,700
Number of features: 11
Target variable: Diagnosis (binary: 1 = liver disease, 0 = no liver disease)
Data Source: Kaggle - Predict Liver Disease Dataset
